        <p n="1-4">Ōm! Reverence to the god Śaṁbhu, who is made beutiful by a <foreign>caurī</foreign> which is the moon that lightly rests upon his lofty head, and who is the foundation-pillar for the erection of the city of the three worlds! May that tree of paradise which is Śaṁbhu, praised by the gods,-which is the abode of the beauty of clusters of flowers which are the rows of drops of water thrown up by the waves of the holy river Gaṅgā; which has for fresh sprouts his dangling matted hair; which has as its growing fruit the ambrosia-rayed moon; which is pleasing with boughs that are his arms; and which is embraced by a creeper that is the goddess Gaurī,-give to Rāma, in particular, with perpetual activity, an abundance of such fruits as are longed for by a petitioner! May Śrīkaṇṭha, who is Īśa<supplied reason="subaudible">in the form of</supplied> Vīra-Sōm̄€śa, surrounded by all the <foreign>gaṇa</foreign>s,-who is adorned by feet in which there are set her and there the numerous crimson rays of the cluster of the jewels in all the tiaras of the multitude of the gods; who is the best of the immortals; and who is the abode of the splendour of the rays of the glances of <supplied reason="explanation">Pārvatī</supplied> the daughter of <supplied reason="explanation">Himālaya</supplied> the lord of the mountain of cold,-always confer good fortune upon Rāmadēva, upon him who is of unequalled greatness!    
        </p>
        <p n="5-10">Round about it <supplied reason="explanation">namely Jambūdvīpa</supplied> is the ocean, which is met by banks of clouds that are the trunks, blowing out sprouts of water, of numerous herds of elephants which agitate the waters by the blow of the tips of their tails that are as efficient in doing so as the shoals of great fish which fall out from months of the fierce monsters of the sea that glide to and from which there rise the rays of many jewels and the lustre of large pearls; which has lines of mountains on its shores; and which is enclosed by the brooad hips of the woman who is the Earth. And there, on the south of Jambūdvīpa, whoch is girt about by the salt ocean whoch is thus beautiful as being the abode of numerous marine animals and the place of very high waves, among all the Nīḷa, NIṣadha, and Himālaya mountains, the cold mountain <supplied reason="subaudible">Himālaya</supplied>,-which has vast glens for rest after the fatigue of the great dalliance of love of the crowd of the dauthers of the <foreign>siddha</foreign>s; which is full of rows and rings of huge rocks falling down from the many piles of mountains that are pounded by the torrent of the waters of <supplied reason="explanation">the Manākinī</supplied> the river of heaven; and which is irradiated by the mass of the tremulous lustre of the cold-rayed moon,-is beautiful with a lenght stretched out so as to measure to eastern and the western oceans.
        </p>
        <p n="10-17">In the land of Bhāratavarṣa, whoch lies oin the southern flank of that same Himālaya, the king of mountains, there shines, with exceedingly great comeliness, the country of Kuntaḷa; and there there is beautiful the city that is called Alande, full of grace and splendour, and ever esteemed to altogether surpass Amarāvatī <supplied reason="explanation">the city of the gods</supplied> with learned people and with a countless wealth of cattle and grain and water. Moreover:-as is well known, in Amarāvatī there are Sukēśi and Mañjughōṣe, these two; but in that town there is a whole multitude of women, all of them with beatiful hair and sweet voices. It is charming with various plantations of sweet-smelling rice, with parks and gardens which are in bloom through all the seasons, with plenty of well-filled tanks and wells and pools, with sounds everywhere of cranes and buzzing bees and cuckoos and ruddy geese and peacocks and numerous flights of parrots and blue jays, and with the music of lutes in the diversions of courtesans. And when it had thus become a place of many charms, as being known to be the site of an infinite number of parks, and pleasing with inexhaustible pools of water, and crowded with many people and the dwelling-place of innumerable courtesans, and the abode of a countless number of merchants, there came down there, from the silver mountain <supplied reason="explanation">Kailāsa</supplied>, accompanied by Girijā <supplied reason="explanation">Pārvatī</supplied>, with great gladness, the god Sōmanātha <supplied reason="explanation">Śiva</supplied>, who has the water-lilies that are his feet made tawny by the mass of the multitude of the rays that dart forth from the jewels inlaid in the tiaras of all the gods, and who is a very tree of paradise having for the ripening of its fruits the accomplishment of the desires of worshippers who bow down before him in supplication.   
        </p>
        <p n="17-20">Among the residents of that town of Sōmanātha, in the Brāhmaṇ quarters, amongst the Brāhmaṇs, there became famous one who resembled those <supplied reason="subaudible">well known</supplied> Vyāsa and Śuka and Vāmadēva and Parāśara and Kapiḷa and others; namely he, Puruṣōttama, who was called the best of Brāhmaṇs,-belonging to the Śrīvatsa gōtra; praised by <supplied reason="subaudible">all other</supplied> Brāhmaṇs; acquainted with all the <foreign>Vēda</foreign>s and <foreign>Vēdāṅga</foreign>s; of an excellent disposition through possessing the virtue of pure behaviour. The good wife of that Brāhmaṇ was Padmāmbike, of pure behaviour, devoted to her husband, who by her virtuous disposition caused herself to be likened to both Sītādēvī <supplied reason="explanation">the wife of Rāma</supplied> and the wife of that <supplied reason="subaudible">well-known</supplied> Satyatapas. And, that husband and wife having remained for a long time without offspring, one day, having come to know the saying of the <foreign>Vēda</foreign> that "there is no heaven for him who has no son", the famous Puruṣōttama, who practised truth and purity, did worship, together with his wife, to Śaṁbhu, in order to obtain a son, saying "Īśa is the protection from misfortune".      
        </p>
        <p n="20-27">At the same time, when Mahēśvara <supplied reason="explanation">Śiva</supplied>, whose feet, resembling water-lilies, are worshipped by the crowd of gods and demons,-with Kēśava <supplied reason="explanation">Viṣṇu</supplied> and Vāsava<supplied reason="explanation">Indra</supplied> and Abjabhava <supplied reason="explanation">Brahman</supplied> in attendance upon him, and surrounde by countless <foreign>Gaṇa</foreign>s, and accompanied by Umā <supplied reason="explanation">Pārvatī</supplied>,-was enjoying the delight of an interchange of pleasing conversations in royal <foreign>darbār</foreign> in a delightful part of the mountain Kaiḷāsa, Nārada, the leader of the <foreign>Gaṇa</foreign>s, spake thus:-"While Ohila, Dāsa, Cenna, Siriyāḷa, Haḷāyudha, Bāṇa, Udbhaṭa and Maḷayēśvara who came here in human form, and Kēśavarāja, and innumerable other <foreign>Gaṇa</foreign>s, resigning the happiness of earthly life, have been dwelling here in this especial excellet abode of faith, the congregation <supplied reason="subaudible">of Śaivas on the earth</supplied> has been afflicted among the Jains and Buddhist". On his speking thus, Mahḕsvara, with a smile on his face that resembled a water-lily, said to Vīrabhadra:-"Do thou, in the world of men, beget a man with a portion of thyself, and then put a stop to those hostile observances". And thereupon Vīrabhadra came in a dream, in the guise of an ascetic, to Puruṣōttamabhaṭṭa, and said:-"There shall be born to thee a son, who shall suppress hostile observances"; and he further said:-"Those many people, in the region of the south, who have tradden in the paths of the Jains, all of them shall be put to shame, O master! By the son <supplied reason="subaudible">who shall be called</supplied> Rāma". Having thus spoken and having manifested great graciousness, he went away. And Puruṣōttamabhaṭṭa, full of content at having succeeded, obtained a son, and performed the birth-ceremony and other rites, and bestowed the name of Rāma in accordance with the bidding of the god.
        </p>
        <p n="27-33">
            And while he <supplied reason="subaudible">Rāma</supplied>, having become imbued with meditation on Śiva in a manner suitable to his divine birth, was practising observances with strict indifference to other things, it came about that, through the intensity of his devotion which was directed entirely to one object, he was called one who had one sole aim; and, having worshipped Śiva with great exclusivenes, he acquired the name of Ēkāntada-Rāma. And in the course of practising observances with speech and body and mind always devoted to the feet of <supplied reason="subaudible">Śiva</supplied> the lord of Gaurī <supplied reason="subaudible">Pārvatī</supplied>, as various sacred places prescribed by the Śaiva traditions and on all the numerous great and small rivers where there are altars of Śaṁbhu, he came and beheld with joy the Sōmanātha of the south, honoured by the gods, who drives away all sins. And when, having thus come, he was worshipping that Sōmanātha of Huligeṟe, whose feet are beautified by the cluster of the rays of the jewels in the tiaras of the greatest of the gods who unceasingly bow down before him, that supreme lord became manifest, and said:-"Go, O Rāma! At my command, to the excellent village of Abbalūru, and take uo thy abode there at ease, and sacrifice to me with strict devotion; and without any apprehension, enter into controversy with the Jains, and wager thy head; and be victorious, O son!"      
        </p>
        <p n="33-38">And when, on the god Sōmanātha having thus given his commands, Ēkāntada-Rāmayya was abiding, with complete indifference to other things, at the shrine of the god Brahmēśvara of Abbalūru, some of the Jains, together with that Saṅkaguaṇḍa, concerted together, and came to obstruct him, and with great resolutness persistently sang <supplied reason="subaudible">of their own god</supplied> in the proximity of Śiva, saying "Jina is the <supplied reason="subaudible">true</supplied> divinity". When he heard that, Ēkāntada-Rāmayya became very full of wrath, and said "It is forbidden to praise any other deity in the proximity of Śiva" but, refusing to desist, they continued vociferating; and then he spake thus:-"Who is it that creates the earth? who is it that protects it in the time of calamity? and further, who is it that is able to destroy it, when his anger becomes great? It is that same Śaṁbhu; and, in the face of the existence of him, who pervades everything, how can he <supplied reason="explanation">Jina</supplied> be a god, who came by chance into the world, and lived in bewilderment, and applied himself to practising austerity, and <supplied reason="subaudible">only thus</supplied> attained happiness? does your <foreign>Arhat</foreign> bestow gifts as Hara <supplied reason="explanation">Śiva</supplied> does? has he ever given even so small a thing? <supplied reason="subaudible">it is</supplied> from Hara <supplied reason="subaudible">that</supplied> in former days the devout <foreign>Gaṇa</foreign>s Bāṇa and Diniśāḷa, and so many others, obtained boons". On his having thus spoken, the Jains said:-"It may be so! but why dost thou simply talk of former worthies? cut off thine own head, under such conditions that all people may know of it, and offer it to him, and get it back from him <supplied reason="subaudible">and then we will admit that</supplied> thou art indeed a pious man and he is indeed the god".
        </p>
        <p n="38-43">When they had thus spoken, Ēkantāda-Rāma said "If I offer my head to <supplied reason="explanation">Śiva</supplied> the foe of Love, and obrain it back, what is the wager that ye will pay to me?"; whereupon they replied, in anger "We will pluck up our Jina and set up <supplied reason="subaudible">an image of</supplied> Śiva". Then, saying "Give me <supplied reason="subaudible">it in writing on</supplied> a palmyra-leaf" and taking the palmyra-leaf that they gave, Rāma brought <supplied reason="subaudible">his image of</supplied> Śiva into the presence <supplied reason="subaudible">of the Jains</supplied> at the place where he was to straightway cut off his head and make an offering of it, and spake thus:-"If I have ever not said that thou alone, O Śaṁbhu, art my protection without fail, and if my thoughts have evere gone astray after other gods, my head shall not go from me by the edge of this scimitar, but otherwise, O Śiva, let it roll down before thy feet" and, thus speaking, the brave Rāma, with a loud shout, and with an unfaltering hand, set himself to cut off his head and lay it at the feet of Śiva. While the disciples were saying "Surely he inflicted but a small wound; he drew the sword and thought, indeed, to do a bold thing, but then he became afraid and has preserved his body unhurt; he must have devised some mischief to the sword <supplied reason="subaudible">blunting it,so that it shall not wound him"</supplied>, Rāma, that man of ability, quickly and instantly cut through his own neck with as little difficulty as if he were shearing through a bundle of grass, and placed <supplied reason="subaudible">his head</supplied> at the feet of Īśa <supplied reason="explanation">Śiva</supplied>, and caused joy to the attendants of Śaṁkara <supplied reason="explanation">Śiva</supplied>.
            
        </p>
        <p n="43-46">After the severed head had been exhibited in public during seven days, Hara kindly gave it back: the head became sound again without any scar; and Rāma received it back, to the knowledge of all people. Inmuch perturbation, all the Jains, in great distress, bowed down on the ground and seized his feet, imploring him to abstain from destroying their Jina; but, refusing to abstain, he fell on it like a thunderbolt from a clear sky, and broke the head of the Jains, crying out that Mārī <supplied reason="explanation">the goddess of plague or death</supplied>
 had come upon them, were running away in flight, he beat the Jina till it fell; and he made them accept the holy Vīra-Sōmēśva.            
        </p>
        <p n="46-51">When the jains, having gone in a body, and having related all the matter in a cunning way to king Bijjaṇa, were, with enmity, making a very slanderous complaint about it, king Bijjaṇa became mad with anger, and looked at Rāmayya with wrath, and said:-"Why hast thou done this evil thing?"; whereupon he shewed the palmyra-leaf that they had given, and said:-"This is the palmyra-leaf that they gave; weight it in thy mind, and place it in thy treasury; let them wager again; if they dare further stake, in thy presence, <supplied reason="subaudible">all</supplied> their various Jinas, then I will cut off my head and place ir as the stake in their hands, and will recover it even after they shall have burned it; but they shall wager to me the various Jinas of their eight hundred shrines, the chief of which is the Ānesejjeyabasadi". Thereupon king Bijjaṇa said:-"We will see this marvel"; and he summoned the wise men of the shrines, and the <supplied reason="subaudible">other</supplied> Jains, and said:-"All of you wager your shrines, and give <supplied reason="subaudible">it in writing on</supplied> a palmyra-leaf. But they said:-"We came to lay a complaint about the shrine which has already been ruined; we have certainly not come to lay a wager and lose <supplied reason="subaudible">any more of</supplied> our Jinas!" Then king Bijjaṇa laughed, and dismissed them, bidding them to go without any further words, and to live in peace; and he gave to Rāmayya, in sch a way that all of them knew of it, a certificate of victory.

The dust of the earth may be counted, and the drops of rain; but the reward of preserving a religious grant cannot be estimated even by the creator.
