                  but in that town there is a whole multitude of women, all of them with beatiful hair

                  and Vāmadēva and Parāśara and Kapiḷa and others; namely he, Puruṣōttama, who was called
                  the best of Brāhmaṇs,-belonging to the Śrīvatsa gōtra; praised by [all other] Brāhmaṇs;
                  acquainted with all the <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>Vēda</i></span>s and <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>Vēdāṅga</i></span>s; of an excellent disposition through possessing the virtue of pure behaviour. The
                  good wife of that Brāhmaṇ was Padmāmbike, of pure behaviour, devoted to her husband,
                  who by her virtuous disposition caused herself to be likened to both Sītādēvī (the
                  wife of Rāma) and the wife of that [well-known] Satyatapas. And, that husband and
                  wife having remained for a long time without offspring, one day, having come to know
                  the saying of the <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>Vēda</i></span> that “there is no heaven for him who has no son”, the famous Puruṣōttama, who practised
                  truth and purity, did worship, together with his wife, to Śaṁbhu, in order to obtain
                  a son, saying “Īśa is the protection from misfortune”. </p>

                  and Abjabhava (Brahman) in attendance upon him, and surrounde by countless <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>Gaṇa</i></span>s, and accompanied by Umā (Pārvatī),-was enjoying the delight of an interchange of
                  pleasing conversations in royal <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>darbār</i></span> in a delightful part of the mountain Kaiḷāsa, Nārada, the leader of the <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>Gaṇa</i></span>s, spake thus:-“While Ohila, Dāsa, Cenna, Siriyāḷa, Haḷāyudha, Bāṇa, Udbhaṭa and Maḷayēśvara
                  who came here in human form, and Kēśavarāja, and innumerable other <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>Gaṇa</i></span>s, resigning the happiness of earthly life, have been dwelling here in this especial
                  excellet abode of faith, the congregation [of Śaivas on the earth] has been afflicted
                  among the Jains and Buddhist”. On his speking thus, Mahḕsvara, with a smile on his
                  face that resembled a water-lily, said to Vīrabhadra:-“Do thou, in the world of men,
                  beget a man with a portion of thyself, and then put a stop to those hostile observances”.
                  And thereupon Vīrabhadra came in a dream, in the guise of an ascetic, to Puruṣōttamabhaṭṭa,
                  and said:-“There shall be born to thee a son, who shall suppress hostile observances”;
                  and he further said:-“Those many people, in the region of the south, who have tradden
                  in the paths of the Jains, all of them shall be put to shame, O master! By the son
                  [who shall be called] Rāma”. Having thus spoken and having manifested great graciousness,
                  he went away. And Puruṣōttamabhaṭṭa, full of content at having succeeded, obtained
                  a son, and performed the birth-ceremony and other rites, and bestowed the name of
                  Rāma in accordance with the bidding of the god. </p>

                  to his divine birth, was practising observances with strict indifference to other
                  things, it came about that, through the intensity of his devotion which was directed
                  entirely to one object, he was called one who had one sole aim; and, having worshipped
                  Śiva with great exclusivenes, he acquired the name of Ēkāntada-Rāma. And in the course
                  of practising observances with speech and body and mind always devoted to the feet
                  of [Śiva] the lord of Gaurī [Pārvatī], as various sacred places prescribed by the
                  Śaiva traditions and on all the numerous great and small rivers where there are altars
                  of Śaṁbhu, he came and beheld with joy the Sōmanātha of the south, honoured by the
                  gods, who drives away all sins. And when, having thus come, he was worshipping that
                  Sōmanātha of Huligeṟe, whose feet are beautified by the cluster of the rays of the
                  jewels in the tiaras of the greatest of the gods who unceasingly bow down before him,
                  that supreme lord became manifest, and said:-“Go, O Rāma! At my command, to the excellent
                  village of Abbalūru, and take uo thy abode there at ease, and sacrifice to me with
                  strict devotion; and without any apprehension, enter into controversy with the Jains,
                  and wager thy head; and be victorious, O son!" </p>  
               <p><sup class="linenumber">33-38</sup>And when, on the god Sōmanātha having thus given his commands, Ēkāntada-Rāmayya was
                  abiding, with complete indifference to other things, at the shrine of the god Brahmēśvara
                  of Abbalūru, some of the Jains, together with that Saṅkaguaṇḍa, concerted together,
                  and came to obstruct him, and with great resolutness persistently sang [of their own
                  god] in the proximity of Śiva, saying “Jina is the [true] divinity”. When he heard
                  that, Ēkāntada-Rāmayya became very full of wrath, and said “It is forbidden to praise
                  any other deity in the proximity of Śiva” but, refusing to desist, they continued
                  vociferating; and then he spake thus:-“Who is it that creates the earth? who is it
                  that protects it in the time of calamity? and further, who is it that is able to destroy
                  it, when his anger becomes great? It is that same Śaṁbhu; and, in the face of the
                  existence of him, who pervades everything, how can he (Jina) be a god, who came by
                  chance into the world, and lived in bewilderment, and applied himself to practising
                  austerity, and [only thus] attained happiness? does your <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>Arhat</i></span> bestow gifts as Hara (Śiva) does? has he ever given even so small a thing? [it is]
                  from Hara [that] in former days the devout <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>Gaṇa</i></span>s Bāṇa and Diniśāḷa, and so many others, obtained boons”. On his having thus spoken,
                  the Jains said:-“It may be so! but why dost thou simply talk of former worthies? cut
                  off thine own head, under such conditions that all people may know of it, and offer
                  it to him, and get it back from him [and then we will admit that] thou art indeed
                  a pious man and he is indeed the god”. </p>  
               <p><sup class="linenumber">38-43</sup>When they had thus spoken, Ēkantāda-Rāma said “If I offer my head to (Śiva) the foe
                  of Love, and obrain it back, what is the wager that ye will pay to me?"; whereupon
                  they replied, in anger “We will pluck up our Jina and set up [an image of] Śiva”.
                  Then, saying “Give me [it in writing on] a palmyra-leaf” and taking the palmyra-leaf
                  that they gave, Rāma brought [his image of] Śiva into the presence [of the Jains]
                  at the place where he was to straightway cut off his head and make an offering of
                  it, and spake thus:-“If I have ever not said that thou alone, O Śaṁbhu, art my protection
                  without fail, and if my thoughts have evere gone astray after other gods, my head
                  shall not go from me by the edge of this scimitar, but otherwise, O Śiva, let it roll
                  down before thy feet” and, thus speaking, the brave Rāma, with a loud shout, and with
                  an unfaltering hand, set himself to cut off his head and lay it at the feet of Śiva.
                  While the disciples were saying “Surely he inflicted but a small wound; he drew the
                  sword and thought, indeed, to do a bold thing, but then he became afraid and has preserved
                  his body unhurt; he must have devised some mischief to the sword [blunting it,so that
                  it shall not wound him”], Rāma, that man of ability, quickly and instantly cut through
                  his own neck with as little difficulty as if he were shearing through a bundle of
                  grass, and placed [his head] at the feet of Īśa (Śiva), and caused joy to the attendants
                  of Śaṁkara (Śiva). </p>  
               <p><sup class="linenumber">43-46</sup>After the severed head had been exhibited in public during seven days, Hara kindly
                  gave it back: the head became sound again without any scar; and Rāma received it back,
                  to the knowledge of all people. Inmuch perturbation, all the Jains, in great distress,
                  bowed down on the ground and seized his feet, imploring him to abstain from destroying
                  their Jina; but, refusing to abstain, he fell on it like a thunderbolt from a clear
                  sky, and broke the head of the Jains, crying out that Mārī (the goddess of plague
                  or death) had come upon them, were running away in flight, he beat the Jina till it
                  fell; and he made them accept the holy Vīra-Sōmēśva. </p>

                  king Bijjaṇa became mad with anger, and looked at Rāmayya with wrath, and said:-“Why
                  hast thou done this evil thing?"; whereupon he shewed the palmyra-leaf that they had
                  given, and said:-“This is the palmyra-leaf that they gave; weight it in thy mind,
                  and place it in thy treasury; let them wager again; if they dare further stake, in
                  thy presence, [all] their various Jinas, then I will cut off my head and place ir
                  as the stake in their hands, and will recover it even after they shall have burned
                  it; but they shall wager to me the various Jinas of their eight hundred shrines, the
                  chief of which is the Ānesejjeyabasadi”. Thereupon king Bijjaṇa said:-“We will see
                  this marvel”; and he summoned the wise men of the shrines, and the [other] Jains,
                  and said:-“All of you wager your shrines, and give [it in writing on] a palmyra-leaf.
                  But they said:-“We came to lay a complaint about the shrine which has already been
                  ruined; we have certainly not come to lay a wager and lose [any more of] our Jinas!"
                  Then king Bijjaṇa laughed, and dismissed them, bidding them to go without any further
                  words, and to live in peace; and he gave to Rāmayya, in sch a way that all of them

                  the earth, to him belongs, at that time, the reward [of making this grant, if he contiues

                  preserving a religious grant cannot be estimated even by the creator. He who confiscates
                  land that has been given, whether by himself or by another, shall be born as a worm
                  in ordure for te duration of sixty thousand years. He who, though capable [of better

                  condition or a man of low caste, he is outside the pale of all religious rites. The

                  he who confiscates shall cause the same number of families to sink down [into hell].

                  other sacred place, but not for men who confiscate the property of gods or Brāhmaṇs.
